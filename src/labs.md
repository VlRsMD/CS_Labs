## Overview
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp; This project contains laboratory works nr. 1 and nr. 2 
for the Cryptography & Security course.

&ensp;&ensp;&ensp; In "caesarCipherNoPermutation" class encryption and decryption 
according to Caesar algorithm with no permutations are done. 
In "caesarCipherWithPermutation" class encryption and decryption according to Caesar algorithm 
with permutations are done. Next the Vigenere algorithm and the Playfair algorithms are implemented.
Next Stream cipher and Block cipher are implemented - that is being done based on XOR operations over bits of
plaintext and keystream (to encrypt) or of ciphertext and stream (to decrypt).
